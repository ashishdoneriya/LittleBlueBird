HOW TO DEPLOY TO EATJ.COM


*****************************************************************************

Launch git, cd ~/LittleBlueBird


EDITING THE HOSTS FILE: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
If you try to save this file, you'll get "Access is denied"
You have to go to Start -> All Programs -> Accessories -> right click Notepad
Choose Run as Administrator
That will pop up a blank notepad doc
Copy the contents of the hosts file to here
Edit the file the way you want
File -> Save As C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts


Run jetty on port 80, not 8080:
LittleBlueBird/build.sbt contains the line: port in container.Configuration := 8080
Change this to 80 and restart the sbt
Most like have to do: netstat -a -o -n because you'll get an error saying address already in use
Then: taskkill /F /PID [pid the port 80 process]


Window -> Preferences -> General -> Network Connections -> SSH2
SSH2 Home:  	C:\Users\bdunklau\.ssh
Private Keys: 	id_dsa,id_rsa


how you commit

git commit -m "comments"




how you push to github

git push origin master



Will re-read the build.sbt and update all dependencies found there

sbt> reload
