2013-07-17  DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY TO EATJ.COM - SOME PROBLEMS (go to bottom)
Following the instructions of 8/22/12
Modified the web.xml file
DID NOT modify default.props - not sure if brentdunklau@sbcglobal.net is still valid
Packaged up the app
  --> Created C:\Users\bdunklau\LittleBlueBird\target\scala-2.9.1\littlebluebird_2.9.1-1.0.war
Renamed the file as gf.war
Created a backup file named gf-2013-07-17.war
Edited the C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file - commented out the line that maps lbb.com to localhost
Opened "database changes.txt"
  --> found out the app_request table was not in eatj.com yet
  --> had to open my local database: Start->My SQL Workbench: 'bdunklau' database
  --> right-click app_request->Copy to Clipboard->Create Statement
  --> ran through the list of all the other database changes.  If the change didn't indicate that it was made on eatj.com, I checked it and made the change if it needed to be made.  Then, either way, I noted that the change was either made or confirmed that it was already made and I dated it 2013-07-17
Start deployment to eatj.com:
http://www.littlebluebird.com/manager/html
In the 'Deploy' section, go to the 'WAR file to deploy' subsection
Browse to C:\Users\bdunklau\LittleBlueBird\target\scala-2.9.1 and pick gf.war
Click Deploy (takes just over 4 mins)
Set the web.xml file back to the way it was for localhost/tomcat

LESSON LEARNED:  the tuckey jar file wasn't included in the war file to tomcat.  I think it's because of this line in build.sbt:  "org.tuckey" % "urlrewritefilter" % "4.0.3" % "container"
I changed that line to this:  "org.tuckey" % "urlrewritefilter" % "4.0.3" % "compile->default"
And now the urlrewritefilter-4.0.3.jar is included in the WEB-INF/lib folder.

SOME PROBLEMS:  Got "301" error when trying to view someone's list.  Comes from app-GiftCtrl.js
You don't have this problem on localhost - database inconsistency?




2012-08-22 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODIFY WEB.XML
See src/main/webapp/web-inf/web.xml:  There's a tag that says FOR JETTY ONLY - REMOVE WHEN DEPLOYING TO TOMCAT
Delete this tag - DON'T COMMENT IT OUT - DELETE IT!

MODIFY DEFAULT.PROPS
change mail.user from bdunklau@yahoo.com to brentdunklau@sbcglobal.net
change mail.password from e27....  to Pi....

cd C:\Users\bdunklau\LittleBlueBird
sbt
package

Should produce this:
[info] Packaging C:\Users\bdunklau\LittleBlueBird\target\scala-2.9.1\littlebluebird_2.9.1-1.0.war ...
[info] Done packaging.
[success] Total time: 33 s, completed Aug 22, 2012 5:58:19 PM

Rename littlebluebird_2.9.1-1.0.war as gf-yyyy-MM-dd.war for backup purposes
Rename littlebluebird_2.9.1-1.0.war as gf.war for deployment purposes

Set the web.xml file back to the way it was for localhost/tomcat


DEPLOYING TO LOCALHOST TOMCAT:
http://localhost:9080/manager/html   (admin/Pi...)
Undeploy the gf app
Deploy using the "WAR file to deploy" section
Tomcat serves the webapp from: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 5.5\webapps



DEPLOYING TO EATJ.COM TOMCAT
Go to C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts and see if www.littlebluebird.com is mapped to 127.0.0.1/localhost
If it is, you have to edit that file first
www.littlebluebird.com/manager/html  (admin/Pi...  also  manager/Pi...)
SEARCH FOR 'giftfairy' EVERYWHERE IN THE CODE

In dev mode, I put this in the address bar:  http://www.facebook.com/dialog/pagetab?app_id=136122483829&next=http://localhost:8080/gf/app/
Obviously, this also needs to change to:     http://www.facebook.com/dialog/pagetab?app_id=136122483829&next=http://www.littlebluebird.com/gf/app/

In facebook.js, change the channelUrl
