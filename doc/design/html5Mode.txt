In app.js, uncomment this line:

	$locationProvider.html5Mode(true)

1/21/13 - Still don't know how to implement html5 mode with (tuckey) url rewriting.  So have taken both of these out.

Note on the menu links:  When you're in html5 mode, href's should not contain #'s

But when you are NOT in html5 mode, you DO need the #'s.
