A is an existing LBB user, but the email A used when registering is not the same as his FB email.

A decides he wants to use the new Login with FB feature.

A gets a new person record assigned to him but doesn't know it.  To A, it looks like his wish list got obliterated!

Why did this happen?

Because all LBB can do is query the person table by facebook id and by facebook email.  In this case, A's record had a null
facebook id because he's an old school user.  So a query by facebook id turns up nothing.

The killer though is that A's LBB email doesn't match his FB email.  So when he logs in via FB, FB passes us the FB email
We query on that and again get nothing.  So all we can assume is that this person is represented in our person table yet

Which of course is wrong!

And there's not much you can do about it except for trying to do some kind of name-matching thing which can get pretty
complicated.

So for now (12/18/12), the approach is: wait for an email from people complaining about "where's my list!"

The same kind of problem - duplicate person records - can also happen if one person invites another person to LBB.
If the person being invited is already an LBB user, and registered with an email different from FB email, then this 
will also generate a duplicate person record for the exact same reasons described above.
