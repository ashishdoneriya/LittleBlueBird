What does it mean to merge users?

It means you have 2 records in the person table to correspond to the same person.  One record contains the person's email.
The other contains the person's facebook id.

When do we have to do a merge?

Start with an existing user A.  His person record has an email address but no facebook id.
Now this person's friend, B, comes along and invites A through the FB invite feature.  The FB invite feature doesn't tell B what A's email address is.
The only thing B knows about A is name and facebook id.  So the only thing LBB can do is query person for facebook id - which will return nothing
because A hasn't logged in via Facebook yet.

So LBB creates a SECOND RECORD in person, this one having A's facebook id.

Then A gets an app request in FB
A clicks to accept
Upon accepting, A gets redirected to LBB
LBB gets a request containing: facebook request id(s), facebook id, and email.

Only after accepting the app request can we associate facebook id with email.

Now we query the person table and discover that the email FB returned is already in our database.

So 2 records in person point to A - we have to get rid of one of them.  One of the records contains email, the other contains facebook id.

We get rid of the record containing the facebook id.  BUT FIRST, we update the record having the email WITH the facebook id.

Also, we can't just delete the record with the facebook id.  We first have to check every table where it may be referenced and we have to 
switch the references to A's original person.id.

WHY DO WE HAVE TO DO ALL THIS CHECKING?...  Because as soon as B invites A, B can immediately start adding things to A's list.
But remember, this is before A has accepted B's app request!  So B is adding things to the SECOND of A's records.
