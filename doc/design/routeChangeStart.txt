app.js contains an $on() function that listens for routeChangeStart events

Most of the time, there will be a $rootScope.user object, so this function doesn't do anything except route the user to the page he wanted.

However, when there IS no $rootScope.user object, things get complicated.  Why is there no $rootScope.user object?  It could be because
the user hit F5/refresh in the browser and wiped out all the javascript stuff.

It could be because the user is coming to LBB from FB or some other site.

If there's no $rootScope.user object, we will see if the user is logged in to FB.

If the user is logged in to FB, and has authorized the app, then FB will pass to us the name, email and facebook id of the logged in user.
With this info, we can query the person table and see if this user is in our database yet.  First we query the person table using the
facebook id (RestService.handleFacebookUser).  If a record is found, a User object is returned in a 1-element List.

If facebook id is not found in the person table, we query person by email.  Here we could get 0, 1 or many rows since emails can be shared.
If 0 rows are returned, RestService.handleFacebookUser will write a record to the person table.  We know the user's name, email and facebook id
That's all we need to create a user account.  We also send a welcome email.

If 1 row is returned, this row has the email we're looking for; it just doesn't contain a facebook id yet.  So we update this record's facebook id
and we update the profile_pic url to match the profile pic on facebook.

If 2 or more rows are returned, RestService.handleFacebookUser returns the List of users to the client without doing anything.  The client
will check to see how many elements were returned, and for cases where there is more than one user in the array, the client will route the
user to a "who are you" page.

If the user is coming to us from FB and is responding to an app request, then we need to mark the app request as accepted (app_request.accept_date)
We also need to delete the app request.

If the user is not logged in to FB, or hasn't authorized the app, we will look for a "user" cookie in the $cookieStore.  When people login using
their LBB info (as opposed to their FB info), we keep their user id (person.id) in a "user" cookie so that we can recreate the User object
if the user ever hits F5/refresh.
