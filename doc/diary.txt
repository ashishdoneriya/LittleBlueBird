2013-06-10  MailerTest: HOW DOES 'PROPS' GET LOADED
The MailerTest is failing and I don't know how 'Props' gets loaded
I can tell it's coming from src/main/resources/props/default.props (as opposed to the one in 'test')
THE FIX: Changed user/pass from brentdunklau@sbcglobal.net/Pi....   to bdunklau@yahoo.com/e...
MailerTest now sends email again


2013-06-09  PROFILE IMAGE NOT SQUARE
In me.html, realized the default/no-profile-pic image wasn't being squared-off like in accountinfo.html
and personalinfo.html.  me.html wasn't using user attributes returned from the server, specifically 
profilepicmarginleft.  See User.suplementalJs - this method is called by the Lift framework whenever you call
User.asJs
THE FIX: I just copied what I was doing in accountinfo.html


2013-06-07  PROFILE IMAGES - WHY AREN'T THEY CROPPED/SQUARED?
Just created a brand new user.  Noticed that when I went to the /me page, the image wasn't cropped/squared
like I expected. WTF - spent a lot of time getting this to work and I notice now it doesn't. Why?


2013-06-07  LOGGING TUCKEY.ORG OUTPUT
I didn't like seeing all the [info] output from tuckey - just realized that the logging level was already set in
the web.xml file.  See the <filter> tag for UrlRewriteFilter


2013-06-03 SCREW IT FOR NOW - NO IE
I tested the app in IE10 and even though the FB login worked, I didn't get very far before
stuff stopped working.  The first thing I found was the add-a-friend feature didn't work
Click the + sign and then "Add by Name" - should pop up a cool Twitter Bootstrap modal/lightbox
But nope - all you get is the fullscreen shadow behind the lightbox - but no lightbox.
SO SCREW IT FOR NOW - NO IE


2013-06-02 Problems with IE
IE9 doesn't like the FB login dialog.  When you login to FB, the dialog just sticks around, blank.
IE10 doesn't have that problem.  F12 will bring up the javascript debugger for IE (and FF and Chrome).
In IE, there is a button at the top of the debugger called Browser Mode that lets you run IE in any
of these versions: 7,8,9,10


2013-06-01 IE doesn't serve up the app unless the F12 debugger is running
Either console or console.log() is undefined when the F12 debugger isn't running.
The fix is described below
See http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?575320-how-not-to-let-console-log%28%29-to-cause-error-on-IE-or-other-browsers
The fix is located right at the top of app.js


2013-05-31 Don't serve up the app to IE users
app.js contains the following in the routeChangeStart event handler:
if($window.navigator.userAgent.indexOf('MSIE') != -1)
