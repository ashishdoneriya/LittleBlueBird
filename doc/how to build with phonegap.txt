iOS builds: use the "Ad Hoc Key" for testing on your phone
Unlock the key using the Pi.... password
Click "Update Code" button to get the latest from github
Not sure if "Update Code" always triggers a build or not
You can rebuild just the iOS version or any of the other 6 versions
When the build is complete, click the blue/green "ipa" button to download the app to your laptop
Should get a prompt from itunes to replace the current version of the app with the new
Choose to replace
Sync the phone with itunes to get the new version
*** Sometimes you don't always get the new version.  You have to remove the app from your phone and then re-install it

Another way to get the app on your phone that might be even easier:
Scan the QR code on the app's page on phonegap:  https://build.phonegap.com/apps/480876/builds
It will ask if you want to install the app on your phone.  I think it does a remove first.
