You can test the mobile app in a browser since the app is just html/javascript/css

At this time (7/25/13), you can't test the facebook part in the browser

LittleBlueBird/www stuff needs to get copied over to LittleBlueBird/src/main/webapp/www

LittleBlueBird/build.xml contains a 'copy' target that will copy this stuff over

Run the build.xml copy target from eclipse

Jack with hosts file: Laptop needs to associate www.littlebluebird.com with 127.0.0.1
Go to c:\windows\system32\drivers\etc
Open the hosts file
Should see this line: 127.0.0.1[tab]www.littlebluebird.com
Add it if you don't see it

cmd

netstat -a -o -n

taskkill /F /PID ...

and then scroll up to the top of the list.  That's usually where the 0.0.0.0:80 process is.  Enter that pid and hit [ENTER] to kill the currently running process

Then,
cd lit[tab]  (should now be at c:\users\bdunklau\littlebluebird
sbt
container:start (up arrow might get you this)

Now the app is running on a jetty web server
The mobile version is:  http://www.littlebluebird.com/gf/www/
