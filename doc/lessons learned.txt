"App on Facebook" at developers.facebook.com - DON'T PICK THIS OPTION
It was creating a bunch of a problems with the auth button in login.html.  The fb dialog would appear, you would login,
but when you clicked login, the dialog wouldn't go away and the 'success' callback function wouldn't get called.
You would get logged in to fb, but the fact that the login dialog doesn't go away, but rather just stares at you blank - was
really making the "login with fb" feature a non-starter.
THEN I HIT THE LITTLE X NEXT TO "App on Facebook" and presto! the fb login dialog started working perfectly.
