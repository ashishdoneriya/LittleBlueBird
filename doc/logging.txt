IF YOU RENAME OF MOVE THIS FILE ********************************************
You have to update LBB Diary.docx because we reference this file from that file



This is the log file:

C:\Users\bdunklau\LittleBlueBird\src\main\resources\logback.xml

When you do a compile, it gets copied over to:

C:\Users\bdunklau\LittleBlueBird\target\scala-2.9.1\classes

Have to switch to Navigator view because the classes directory isn't displayed in the Project Explorer view
