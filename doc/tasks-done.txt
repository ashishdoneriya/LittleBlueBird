Noticed after deploying to eatj.com on 8/23/12: 
- DONE:  SPAM FILTER CAUGHT THE WELCOME EMAIL.  
    Should add an "alert" to the welcome page saying a welcome email was sent, to check for it in spam if necessary 
    and add info@littlebluebird.com contacts
    ALSO ADD A "RESEND EMAIL" LINK TO THIS ALERT SO THE USER CAN VERIFY THAT HE IS RECEIVING EMAILS FROM US
