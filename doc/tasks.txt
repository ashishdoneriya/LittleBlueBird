TASK:  ddbtn-addcircle.html and mycircles.html have the same monstrous bunch of code related to adding participants to circles.
Not sure what the difference is.  There had to be a reason for duplicating all of this code.  There must be some slight
variation that kept the code from being reusable - IT'S A LOT OF CODE.

UPDATE 7/20/12:  Don't even go there.  Already tried creating directive to serve both add-event and edit-event function.
The difference is just enough to where it's easier to have two similar modals.  At least the two modal call a lot of
the same functions in CircleCtrl (or whatever)


Events
	- changing name and date: DONE but date change from active to expired (or v.v.) won't put the event in the other category until you hit refresh or login again
	- adding/removing people: DONE but need to do something about people that have gifts bought for them already.  Prompt the person?  Prevent person from being removed?
	- add "recurring" attribute to events - db change
	
Reminders
	- define default reminders by event type OR define the same reminders to apply to all events
	- let users add/remove reminders for everyone in an event
	- let users add/remove reminders for certain people in an event
	
Add and Edit Events (2 different modals)
	- DONE:  include Past Events - right now, when you add people from another event, the only options are active events

Buying Gifts:  The save, buy, cancel buttons need to be looked at

Edit Gifts
	- DONE: email buyer if item has been bought - include old and new descriptions and old and new links

Deleting Gifts
	- DONE: email buyer if item has been bought and then deleted. The item is actually deleted, not just marked as deleted
	  
My Wish List
	- Make refresh go back to My Wish List page
	
Users
	- alert if no email on file 
	  needed for password recovery, also see "Email alerts" section below)
	- Delete account - there is
	- "change password" not implemented
	- hide password in all query results
	
Email alerts
	- welcome email when you create your account
	- DONE  welcome email when someone creates your account for you
	- DONE  when you have bought a gift that someone later edits
	- DONE  when you have bought a gift that someone later deletes
	- DONE  when someone returns an item that was previously bought
	- when someone adds you to an event
	- when someone drops you from an event ?
	
Static pages
	- "What Is It?" page
	- "Tell Me More" page
	- "Features" page
	
Not sure how many pages I need or their titles.  But I need page(s) that say
	- What this site is
	- How it works
	- Why it's different
	
Welcome page - Right after the user creates his account, what does he see?
	- needs to be prompted to create events
	- needs to be prompted to add people to events
	- needs to be prompted to create his wish list

Affiliate program
	- detect amazon url's and modify with my tag
	
Browser button - crossrider.com - "Add to Wish List" button

Facebook
	- share an item on fb
	- share my list on fb
	
Customize viewing rules - Right now, the site determines when to show you an item and when 
to allow you to edit it and delete it.  These rules don't always make sense though.  
When we add items to Kiera's list, sometimes she knows about them.  She should be able to
see any item she knows about.  But LBB assumes that she doesn't know about them so she can't
see them

"Buddy List" - Right now, the only way to see someone's list is if they are in an event with you.
If you have no active events, then you can't update your children's lists.
