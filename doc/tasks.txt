Noticed after deploying to eatj.com on 8/23/12: 
- Profile pics are smaller than on localhost and some look shifted to the left or chopped off - my dad's especially
- Event names always wrap - looks horrible.  Either make the font smaller or make the Event section span another column
- Reminders for [event] wraps to the next line - but there's space on the same line in most cases.  Avoid wrapping.
- Reminders: When the event is passed, there are no reminders, but there is still an empty white box where the reminders
  			would have gone and it looks like you can still add reminders.  Get rid of all this when the event has past
  			Put up a note that says the event has past or disable the reminders link in the Edit Event pull down under 
  			the event.
- Past Events:  Need a link to show/hide past events.  Right now, we show everything



TASK:  ddbtn-addcircle.html and mycircles.html have the same monstrous bunch of code related to adding participants to circles.
Not sure what the difference is.  There had to be a reason for duplicating all of this code.  There must be some slight
variation that kept the code from being reusable - IT'S A LOT OF CODE.

UPDATE 7/20/12:  Don't even go there.  Already tried creating directive to serve both add-event and edit-event function.
The difference is just enough to where it's easier to have two similar modals.  At least the two modal call a lot of
the same functions in CircleCtrl (or whatever)


Events
	- add "recurring" attribute to events - db change
	
Reminders
	- just send out one email per event - cc everyone
	- The reminder emails should say when the next reminder will be sent
	- and should give the user the option to stop receiving them
	
Add and Edit Events (2 different modals)

Buying Gifts:  The save, buy, cancel buttons need to be looked at

Edit Gifts

Deleting Gifts
	  
My Wish List
	- Make refresh go back to My Wish List page
	
Users
	- alert if no email on file 
	  needed for password recovery, also see "Email alerts" section below...  If a person hasn't entered their email address,
	  they're going to want to, otherwise they won't get emails when they are added to events.  They won't get emails when
	  gifts they have purchased get deleted or their descriptions changed.  And they can't get their password emailed to them
	  if they forget it.
	- Delete account - there is no way to delete someone's account right now
	- "change password" not implemented
	- hide password in all query results
	
Email alerts
	- when someone drops you from an event ?  WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS
	- use cc or bcc on reminders to cut down on the number of emails that go out.  No big deal that we can't
	     address people by name this way.  Have to see how the Executor is set up... Are the recipients
	     established when the Executor is created?  Or are the recipients determined when the Executor fires?
	     If the recipients are determined just before the Executor fires, then we won't have to do any
	     refactoring on the Executor.  If the recipients are "baked" into the Executor, then adding/removing
	     people from the circle would require us to cancel one Executor and create another one with the
	     new set of email recipients.
	
Static pages
 	- Welcome page - with blurb about email we just sent "check your spam filter".  Link to Getting Started page.
 	- Getting Started page
	- "What Is It?" page
	- "Tell Me More" page
	- "Features" page
	
Not sure how many pages I need or their titles.  But I need page(s) that say
	- What this site is
	- How it works
	- Why it's different
	
Welcome page - Right after the user creates his account, what does he see?
	- NEEDS A LOT OF WORK
	- needs to be prompted to create events
	- needs to be prompted to add people to events
	- needs to be prompted to create his wish list

Affiliate program
	
Browser button - crossrider.com - "Add to Wish List" button

Facebook
	- share an item on fb
	- share my list on fb
	
Customize viewing rules - Right now, the site determines when to show you an item and when 
to allow you to edit it and delete it.  These rules don't always make sense though.  
When we add items to Kiera's list, sometimes she knows about them.  She should be able to
see any item she knows about.  But LBB assumes that she doesn't know about them so she can't
see them

"Buddy List" - Right now, the only way to see someone's list is if they are in an event with you.
If you have no active events, then you can't update your children's lists.
