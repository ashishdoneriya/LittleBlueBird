user: may or may not have a record in the person table
      person record may or may not have an email address
      person record may or may not have fb id
      person record may have an email address that is shared by other person records
      
fb:   user may or may not already be logged in to fb
      user may not have a fb account


Test =====================================================================

User is already logged in to fb
User has an account in LBB with matching email
User's LBB account does not have fb id
User's LBB account does not have profile pic

THIS HAS BEEN TESTED A LOT.  Realized that the $rootScope.$emit() calls were in the wrong place.  They needed
to be INSIDE the callback function of the User.save call that saves the fb id and profile pic.
