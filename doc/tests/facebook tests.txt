TEST ****
Not logged in to fb
Person table is empty
Click "Login with FB" button
Login as bdunklau@gmail.com/P.....
Should get sent to Welcome page


TEST ****
Not logged in to fb
Person table is populated, several people have bdunklau@gmail.com addresses,
but no one has a facebook id yet
Run RecipientTest to populate the person table this way
Click "Login with FB" button
Login as bdunklau@gmail.com/P.....
Should get sent to the "Who Are You?" page where you see everyone that
has the bdunklau@gmail.com address
Click "Brent Dunklaux"
Should get sent to "My Wish List" page
One of the records in the person table should now have a facebook id

What does this Use Case represent?  It represents "legacy" users, people that
are already LBB users, they have just never logged in via fb before.  Moreover,
one of these people has created accounts for others using his own email address.
So we don't know who to assign the facebook id to.  That's why we have to first
send them to the Who Are You page.  After clicking on one of those people, we 
can send him to the My Wish List page because this person is already familiar
with LBB.  We don't send him to the Welcome page and we don't send him to the
Getting Started page.



THIS STUFF BELOW IS PROBABLY USEFUL, BUT I DECIDED TO TAKE A DIFFERENT APPROACH ABOVE.
INSTEAD, I DECIDED TO DOCUMENT THE TESTS I HAD ACTUALLY PERFORMED RATHER THAN TRY TO
DOCUMENT ALL THE TESTS I *COULD* RUN.  DOCUMENTING ALL THE TESTS I *COULD* RUN ALWAYS
LEFT WE WONDERING: HAVE I COVERED EVERYTHING?

PLUS THE TESTS ABOVE ARE WRITTEN IN MORE OF A "HERE'S HOW YOU ACTUALLY RUN THIS TEST"
KIND OF LANGUAGE THAT THE TESTS BELOW DON'T HAVE.


Sept 2012 =========================================================================

user: may or may not have a record in the person table
      person record may or may not have an email address
      person record may or may not have fb id
      person record may have an email address that is shared by other person records
      
fb:   user may or may not already be logged in to fb
      user may not have a fb account


Test =====================================================================

User is already logged in to fb
User has an account in LBB with matching email
User's LBB account does not have fb id
User's LBB account does not have profile pic

THIS HAS BEEN TESTED A LOT.  Realized that the $rootScope.$emit() calls were in the wrong place.  They needed
to be INSIDE the callback function of the User.save call that saves the fb id and profile pic.

User is already logged in to fb
User does not have an LBB account
