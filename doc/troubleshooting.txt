PROBLEM:  Facebook login dialog doesn't go away - doesn't call the "success" function
When this happens, LBB does not get any info from fb about who logged.  This problem seriously hoses
up everything downstream in LBB.

TRY THIS:
It makes no sense, but...  foo.html at one time (maybe still is) an exact copy of login.html.  Ctrl-A/Ctrl-C on foo.html to copy
all of it.  Then go over to login.html and do Ctrl-A/Ctrl-V to overlay foo.html on top of login.html.  The reload the page and 
retry.  I have no idea why this works but it worked time again when I was developing/debugging this in Oct 2012.
