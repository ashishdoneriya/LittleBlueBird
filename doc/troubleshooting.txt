PROBLEM:  Facebook login dialog doesn't go away - doesn't call the "success" function
When this happens, LBB does not get any info from fb about who logged.  This problem seriously hoses
up everything downstream in LBB.

TRY THIS:
Make a trivial change to login.html - like add a whitespace char and save

ALSO TRY THIS:
Get a new browser window
