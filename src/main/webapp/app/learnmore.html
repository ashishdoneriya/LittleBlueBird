<h1>What is LittleBlueBird ?</h1>
<div class="font18 padtop5">It's your wish list online.  It's the only place you and your family need to go to find out what everyone wants.</div>


<h1 class="padtop50">How Does It Work?</h1>
<b>Create events</b> in LittleBlueBird like Christmas, your birthday, your anniversary... (you get the idea).
<P>
<b>Add your friends and family</b> to these events so you can see their lists, and they can see yours. 

<h1 class="padtop50">How Do I Start?</h1>
Just go to <a href="/gf/app">www.LittleBlueBird.com</a> and sign up. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Once you create your account, we recommend creating an account for everyone 
in your family.  (Yes, you can create accounts for other people - just <i>one</i> of the things that sets LittleBlueBird apart from every other
wish list and gift registry site out there.)


<h1 class="padtop50">The LittleBlueBird Difference</h1>


<h2 class="normal padtop20">Events</h2>
Most sites have no concept of an event - you just create a list of stuff you want.  But that's not how wish lists 
work, is it?
<P>You don't just want stuff, you want stuff <i>for</i> Christmas, <i>for</i> your birthday <i>for</i> your anniversary.

No other site has the concept of an Event, like Christmas or your birthday, which is a little strange if you ask us.  
After all, you're asking for something <i>because</i> it's Christmas or <i>because</i> it's your birthday.
<P>
And what happens when the event is over?  LittleBlueBird will still display the event.  Only now, it will show you
what you got <i>for</i> that event!



<h2 class="normal padtop20">Quickly See Everyone's List</h2>

<h2 class="normal padtop20">See What Everyone Is Getting</h2>

<h2 class="normal padtop20">Don't Show Me What I'm Getting</h2>

<h2 class="normal padtop20">Add to Someone Else's List</h2>
you children, spouses, for surprises, manage your whole family


<h2 class="normal padtop20">Specify Multiple Recipients</h2>
Can you specify that a gift has multiple recipients?  With LittleBlueBird you can.  With any other site?  Don't count on it.
<P>But isn't it realistic that a husband and wife would want something <i>together</i>, or that grandparents would give a gift
for <i>all</i> the grandchildren to share?  Of course.


<h2 class="normal padtop20">Shopping List</h2>

<h2 class="normal padtop20">"Smart" Editing / "Smart" Deleting</h2>

<h2 class="normal padtop20">Create Accounts for Other People</h2>
With LittleBlueBird, you can create accounts for other people.  This comes in handy when you have
families with small children that can't create their own accounts.  




<h2 class="normal padtop20">Finding Someone's Wish List</h2>
How do you see someone else's list?  On LittleBlueBird, all of your friends and family are listed under each event you are
participating in.  Just click someone's name.  On any other site, you'll have to enter each person's name or email address 
or user handle.

<h2 class="normal">LittleBlueBird Won't Spoil the Surprise!</h2>
What good is a wish list site that tells you what you're getting?  LittleBlueBird will never spoil the surprise.  You will
never know what you're getting until you've gotten it.

On any other site ...sorry.  There's a pretty good chance you'll know exactly what you're getting from Mom, from Dad, 
...from everyone.  Other sites don't even <i>try</i> to maintain the surprise

<h2 class="normal">See What Everyone Else is Getting</h2>
Even though LittleBlueBird won't show you what <i>you</i> are getting, we <i>will</i> show you what everyone <i>else</i>
is getting.

<h2 class="normal">Add to Someone Else's List</h2>
With LittleBlueBird, you can add items to <i>other</i> people's lists.  Why would you want to do that?
<P>
Young children, manage other peoples lists, put surprises - so other people can get ideas off your gifts
