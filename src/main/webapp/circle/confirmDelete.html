  <div class="alert alert-warning"><h4 class="alert-heading">Delete This Event?</h4>Are You Sure? Once you delete this event, 
    you won't be able to get it back. We recommend keeping events even after they have past.  That way, if 
    you need gift ideas, you can see what people got in the past.
